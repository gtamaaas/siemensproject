Project created for the Siemens 2024 Summer Java internship.
The project is a web application for a hotel reservation management, based on real world data found in the hotels.json file. It contains the geographical data for hotels, so the user can filter based on
the distance between him and the hotels. After, for each hotel, the user can make a reservation for a certain period (only if said room is available, or not yet reserved).

Technologies used:
- React
- Spring
- H2 in-memory database

Missing features:
- feedback
- reservation modification/deletion
